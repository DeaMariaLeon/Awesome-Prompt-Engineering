## Image Prompting
Text-to-Image prompting is a fascinating area of AI that can help us generate high-quality images from textual prompts. 
We can achieve our desired image output by adjusting the resolution, styles, and repetition parameters. 
Higher resolution leads to more detailed and realistic images, making it an essential parameter for applications where visual fidelity is critical. 
Styles allow us to manipulate the visual style of generated images to match our desired aesthetic, such as incorporating the style of a particular artist or genre. 
Repetition can be used to generate coherent sequences of images that follow a specific pattern or concept, 
enabling us to tell a story or showcase a series of related images. By leveraging these prompt engineering parameters, 
we can create text-to-image models that produce high-quality and diverse outputs, making this field an exciting and valuable area of research for various applications, 
including content creation, design, and marketing.
