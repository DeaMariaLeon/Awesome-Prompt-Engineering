## Introduction
Welcome to our **Awesome Prompt Engineering** Github Repository! Prompt engineering is an essential component of natural language processing (NLP)
that involves designing prompts or input queries for AI models that generate natural language text. The quality of these prompts significantly 
impacts the quality and relevance of the output text. This field is becoming increasingly important as AI models are used more frequently in 
various applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and text summarization. Effective, prompt engineering can improve the performance of 
these models and make them more useful for a wide range of applications. We are excited to provide a resource for developers and researchers to 
learn more about this exciting field and to contribute to its continued growth and development.
