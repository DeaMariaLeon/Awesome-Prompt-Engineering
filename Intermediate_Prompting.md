## Intermediate prompting
Intermediate prompting is an advanced technique in prompt engineering that enables AI models to generate more nuanced and complex outputs. 
There are several methods of intermediate prompting, including chain-of-thought, zero-shot, self-consistency, and least-to-most prompting. 
Chain-of-thought prompting involves breaking down a complex task into a sequence of smaller tasks and prompting the AI model with each task in succession. 
Zero-shot prompting, on the other hand, allows the model to generate outputs for tasks it has never seen before by training it on a diverse range of tasks. 
Self-consistency prompts ensure that the generated outputs are consistent with the input prompt. 
At the same time, least-to-most prompting helps avoid generating implausible outputs by prompting the model with a range of possible outputs and 
selecting the most likely correct. These methods can be combined to improve the accuracy and quality of AI-generated outputs, making intermediate 
prompting an essential technique for AI engineers looking to develop advanced AI models.
